$Franc is the basic currency on MamboSwap.

other stablecoins will be added.


It runs live on https://Mafre-Swap.mambo.li 

We may run other MamboSwaps in future and update the contract and GUI.

A MamboSwap Clone will be used as MILO, Mambo Initial Launch Offering.
This will enable probably the most fair token launches possible with limited amount per account and fixed rates.

Future tasks will be: the BUY and SELL exchange rate accuracy is currently on two decimals only. 
A future update should make it possibe to have at least 4 decimals accuracy.
If you are a programmer who knows to do this easily, 
contact an admin of the telegram group MamboToken .
