Other stablecoins like xsgd and soon mDAI can be swapped at fixed rates to FRANC and vice versa.
It runs live on https://Mafre-Swap.mambo.li 

We may run other MamboSwaps in future and update the contract and GUI.

Future tasks will be: the BUY and SELL exchange rate accuracy is currently on two decimals only. 
A future updat should make it possibe to have at least 4 decimals accuracy.
If you are a programmer who knows to do this easily, 
contact an admin of the telegram group MamboToken .
