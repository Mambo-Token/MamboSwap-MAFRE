# MamboSwap-MAFRE

update August 2024: Mambo moved it's activity out of zilliqa to kaspa since June 2024.
The information below is maintained for view only to give a track record of our activities.
MamboSwaps fixed rates Exchange was probably the first if it's kind and an good tool for fair launches.
We made proof of concept with the help of MamboSwap for our former "stablecoin" concept.
In future we will focus on solidcoins (not stablecoins) to completely abandon the fiat shitcoin world.
We plan to develop in future and even more sophisticated fixed rates swap on Kaspa, once it is smart contract ready.

Contract Code and address of MamboSwap - Infos and further Development
First of it's kind Fixed Rated Swap from mambo.li.
MAFRE, MamboSwap Automated Fixed Rates Exchange contract address on ziliqa is:
zil1pfvzz9vqpc60j3l2n3ltc586l65gvahj85xxg7

The basic Swap Token of this contract is set at FRANC, Chocolate Stablecoin.
zil1z4hxwnqk9gu6tamcw4umxss9wjpmrkhzdh4n85

$Franc is the basic currency on MamboSwap.
$Franc can currently be swapped at fixes rates to following tokens (will be updated occasionally):
$XSGD
$zUSDT
$MILKY
$mUSD
$THANKS
other stablecoins will be added.


It runs live on https://Mafre-Swap.mambo.li 

We may run other MamboSwaps in future and update the contract and GUI.

A MamboSwap Clone will be used as MILO, Mambo Initial Launch Offering.
This will enable probably the most fair token launches possible with limited amount per account and fixed rates.

Future tasks will be: the BUY and SELL exchange rate accuracy is currently on two decimals only. 
A future update should make it possibe to have at least 4 decimals accuracy.
If you are a programmer who knows to do this easily, 
contact an admin of the telegram group MamboToken .
